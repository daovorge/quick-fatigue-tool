This document provides a quick guide for getting started with Quick Fatigue Tool.
For a complete description of the code and its features, please consult the
Quick Fatigue Tool User Guide.


%   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
%   ==========================
%	>> The tutorial_intro example exits with errors
%
%	It is likely that not all the required files are on the MATLAB path.
%   Select the 'Application_Files' and 'Project' folders from the current
%   folder window, right-click and select 'Add to Path -> Selected Folders
%   and Subfolders'.
%
%   >> The Quick Fatigue Tool MATLAB apps do not display correctly; labels
%      and text is misaligned or cut off
%
%   The apps are optimized for a 1920x1080 screen resolution. Running the 
%   apps on other screen sizes may cause UI object to appear incorrectly.
%   Re-size the window if necessary. On Windows machines, UI objects look
%   best when the global icon size is set to 125% (Control Panel\All
%   Control Panel Items\Display)
%
%	>> When starting an analysis with the Multiaxial Gauge Fatigue App, the
%	user receives the following error: "Error while processing material
%	'material.mat'. The file could not be located."
%
%	Make sure all the fodlers are added to the MATLAB path. Run the
%	Multiaxial Gauge Fatigue App directly from the M-File: Right-click on
%	Application_Files\code\multiaxial_gauge_fatigue\MultiaxialGaugeFatigue.m
%   and select "Run".
%
%   PERFORMING AN ANALYSIS
%   ======================
%
%   All user definitions are specified in the script <job-name>.m. Running 
%	<job-name>.m starts the analysis.
%
%   LOADING METHODS
%   ===============
%
%   The loading is defined by stress datasets and load histories.
%   The loading can be defined in five ways:
%
%	UNIAXIAL HISTORY
%	A load history is supplied without a stress dataset
%
%   SIMPLE LOADING
%   A stress dataset is combined with a load history.
%
%   MULTIPLE LOAD HISTORY (SCALE-AND-COMBINE) LOADING
%   FEA results may contain multiple stress datasets defining several
%   sequential or combined loading events. Each result is specified by a
%   separate stress dataset. A load history is multiplied by each dataset.
%   The resulting loadings are combined to form a single loading definition
%   for the whole model.
%
%   DATASET SEQUENCES
%   The loading is defined by a sequence of stress datasets.
%
%	COMPLEX (BLOCK SEQUENCE) LOADING
%	Each analysis job is treated as a single loading block in a chain of events.
%	Fatigue damage is accumulated between each job.
%
%   The stress data can be an .rpt file generated by Abaqus, or a user-defined
%   ASCII text file containing the stress tensors for each item in the
%   finite element model. The load history is an ASCII text file or an in-line
%	definition containing a series of scale factors or load values corresponding
%	to the dataset with which it is paired.
%
%   Examples:
%	Define a uniaxial history using a text file or an in-line definition:
%		DATASET = '';
%		HISTORY = 'history-file-name.*';
%		HISTORY = [200, -200];
%
%   Define a simple loading using text files:
%       DATASET = 'dataset-file-name.*';
%       HISTORY = 'history-file-name.*';
%
%   Define a multiple load history
%       DATASET = {'dataset-1-file-name.*', 'dataset-2-file-name.*',..., 'dataset-N-file-name.*'};
%       HISTORY = {'history-1-file-name.*', 'history-2-file-name.*',..., 'history-N-file-name.*'};
%
%   Define a dataset sequence
%       DATASET = {'dataset-1-file-name.*', 'dataset-2-file-name.*',..., 'dataset-3-file-name.*'};
%       HISTORY = [];
%
%   When specifying multiple dataset/history pairs, each stress dataset must
%	refer to the same model. Hence, the number of items in each dataset
%	file must be the same. The length of each load history does not have
%   to be the same.
%
%   GENERATING A USER-DEFINED STRESS DATASET
%   ========================================
%
%   If the stress channels are defined as a .dat file, the following format
%   must be obeyed:
%
%   LINE 1:            S1_11 S1_22 S1_33 S1_12 S1_13 S1_23
%   LINE 2:            S2_11 S2_22 S2_33 S2_12 S2_13 S2_23
%   .                  .
%   .                  .
%   .                  .
%   LINE N:            SN_11 SN_22 SN_33 SN_12 SN_13 SN_23
%
%   Where SN_11 to SN_23 are the six components of the Cauchy stress tensor
%   at the Nth item in the model.
%
%   GENERATING A STRESS DATASET FROM ABAQUS
%   =======================================
%
%   1. In Abaqus/CAE, switch to the Visualization module
%   2. Go to "Result -> Options". Make sure that the option "Average element
%   output at nodes" is unchecked
%   3. Go to "Report -> Field Output..."
%   4. In the variable tab, choose the output position. The following
%   positions are supported:
%   - Integration Point
%   - Centroid
%   - Element Nodal
%   - Unique nodal
%   5. Expand the "S: Stress components" tree and check the last 6 variables
%   (the Cauchy stress tensor). Make sure that all other boxes are unchecked.
%	If plane stress elements were used, only the last 4 variables need to be
%	selected
%   6. In the "Setup" tab under "Output Format", make sure the layout style
%   is set to "Single table for all field output variables"
%   7. Under "Data", uncheck "Column totals" and "Column min/max" as these
%   are not required. GETITEMS has not been validated for RPT files with
%   this information included
%
%	When generating FEA definition files from Abaqus using plane stress
%	elements, TENSOR_TYPE should be set to a value of 1.0 in the job file.
%
%   GENERATING A LOAD HISTORY
%   =========================
%
%   The load history file contains a 1xN or Nx1 vector of loading points.
%   For a fully-reversed loading, the loading file would be defined as follows:
%
%   LINE 1:            1
%   LINE 2:            -1
%
%   The analysis does not recognise the amount of elapsed time between
%   history points.
%
%   MATERIAL PROPERTIES
%   ===================
%
%   Material properties are defined using the Material Manager app. The
%   app can be run from the apps bar by installing
% 	Application_Files\toolbox\Material Manager.mlappinstall.
%
%	Alternatively, the Material Manger GUI can be called with the following
%	commands:
%
%	>> MaterialManager
%	>> material.create()
%	>> material.edit('material-name')
%
%   ANALYSIS OPTIONS
%   ================
%
%   Job-specific analysis settings are set by options in the job file. Analysis
%   settings which apply to all jobs are set by environment variables in the
%   file 'environment.m'.
%
%   For a detailed description on how to use job options and environment variables,
%   consult the Quick Fatigue Tool User Settings Reference Guide.
%
